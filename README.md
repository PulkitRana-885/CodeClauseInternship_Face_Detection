# CodeClauseInternship_Face_Detection
A Python-based face detection project developed during my CodeClause internship. Detects human faces in images/videos using OpenCV and Haar cascades (or deep learning models like MTCNN). Ideal for learning computer vision basics and building security/attendance systems.
